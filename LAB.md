## Future Plan
* [ ] highlight sidebar toc when scroll sync.  
* [ ] support `pandoc` as filter.
* [x] multiple preview panes.  
* [ ] support inline JavaScript.  
```markdown
---
version: 12
---
# {{version}}
{{version}} is cool
```
* [x] support `@import` online markdown file.    
* [x] add `Welcome` page.
* [ ] upload image to github repo.
```
1. clone image-repo if not existed.
2. use nodegit to add and push image to the repo.
